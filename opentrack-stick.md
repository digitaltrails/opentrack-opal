opentrack-stick - opentrack to Linux HID stick events
=====================================================

Translate opentrack UDP-output to Linux-HID joystick events.

Usage:
======

    python3 opentrack-stick.py [-d] [-t]

Optional Arguments
------------------

    -d           Output joystick event x, y, z values to stdout for debugging purposes.
    -t           Training: limit each axis to large changes to eliminate other-axis "noise"
                 when mapping an axis within a game.

Description
===========

opentrack-stick listens for opentrack-output UDP-packets and uses evdev
to inject them into Linux input subsystem as HID joystick events.

The evdev joystick events are introduced at the HID device level and are
independent of X11/Wayland, applications cannot differentiate them
from ordinary joystick events.  This means opentrack-stick will work in
any application, including environments such as Steam Proton.

Quick Start
===========

Get the python (python-3) ebdev library:

    pip install ebdev

Requires udev rule for access:

sudo cat > /etc/udev/rules.d/65-opentrack-evdev.rules <EOF
KERNEL=="event*", SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{name}=="opentrack*",  TAG+="uaccess"
EOF
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules ; udevadm trigger

Run this script:

    python3 opentrack-stick.py

Start opentrack; select Output `UDP over network`; configure the
output option to IP address 127.0.0.1, port 5005; start tracking;
move head.

Opentrack Protocol
==================

Each opentrack UDP-Output packet contains 6 little-endian
doubles: x, y, z, yaw, pitch, and roll.
